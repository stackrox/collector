The intention of run-tests.sh is to test that get-builder-flavor.sh is working as desired. To run the tests execute the following

./run-tests.sh

To create and run your own tests create a file <my-tests> with the following format

version distro expected_build

See TestInput.txt for an example

Then execute the following

./run-tests.sh <my-tests>

The default tests file is TestInput.txt
