# This script checks the 'circleci-agent' command exists before attempting to
# call it. We were having failures in CircleCI where the 'circleci' command was
# not found, so this script attempts to mitigate this problem by:
# - Checking the command exists before calling it.
# - Retry up to 5 times every 5 seconds if the first call fails.
#
# The 'circleci' command was also replaced by ' circleci-agent', since this last
# command is actually in charge of handling 'circleci step' calls.
