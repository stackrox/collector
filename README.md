# Collector

## Collector development

### Cloning the repo

Since the collector repo uses a submodule for the sysdig source, use
the following command to clone.

```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:stackrox/collector.git
```

### Development with an IDE (CLion)

#### Setup
These instructions are for using the *JetBrains* C/C++ IDE **CLion**, but should be adaptable to any IDE that supports development over ssh/sftp.
- If running CLion IDE for the first time:
  - Download and install CLion (https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/)
  - Create a project from the `collector/collector` directory using an existing CMakeLists file (`collector/collector/CMakeLists.txt`).
- Create the collector builder container if not already running, or if the builder image has changed.
  - `make start-dev`
    - (Optional) Local builder images can used by setting the environment variable before execution using `BUILD_BUILDER_IMAGE=true make start-dev`.
Or, builder images from a PR by with `COLLECTOR_BUILDER_TAG=<circle-build-id> make start-dev`.

Instructions for Mac OS
- In the **CLion->Preferences** window, add a new **Toolchain** entry in settings under **Build, Execution, Deployment** as a **Remote Host** type.
- Then, click in the **Credentials** section and fill out the SSH credentials used in the builder Dockerfile.
  - Host: `localhost`, Port: `2222`, User name: `remoteuser`, Password: `c0llectah`
- Next, select **Deployment** under **Build, Execution, Deployment**, and then **Mappings**. Set **Deployment path** to `/tmp`.
- Finally, add a CMake profile that uses the **Remote Host** toolchain and change **Build directory**/**Generation Path** to `cmake-build`.

Instructions for Linux
- In the **File->Settings->Build, Execution, Deployment->Toolchains** window, add a new **Toolchain** entry as a **Remote Host** type.
- Then, click in the **Credentials** section and fill out the SSH credentials used in the builder Dockerfile.
  - Host: `localhost`, Port: `2222`, User name: `remoteuser`, Password: `c0llectah`
- In the **File->Setting->Build, Execution, Deployment->Deployment** window click on the **Mappings** tab. Set **Deployment path** to /tmp.
- In the **File->Settings->Build, Execution, Deployment->CMake** window add a CMake profile that uses the **Remote Host** toolchain and change **Build directory**/**Generation Path** to `cmake-build`.

#### Teardown
- Run `make teardown-dev` to remove the builder container and associated ephemeral ssh keys from `$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts`
- After restarting, you may need click **Resync with Remote Hosts** under the **Tools** menu in **CLion**.

#### Compilation and Testing
- To build the sysdig wrapper libary and collector binary: select the *collector* configuration from the **Run...** menu and then **Build**.
- To run unit tests, select the *runUnitTests* configuration and then select **Run**.

### Development with Visual Studio Code
#### Setup for C++ using devcontainers
Visual Studio Code can be used as a development environment by leveraging its devcontainers feature.
- Install the [remote-containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension.
- Create a `.devcontainer.json` file under `collector` and set the `image` attribute to `quay.io/stackrox-io/collector-builder:cache`
```json
{
  "name": "collector-dev",
  "image": "quay.io/stackrox-io/collector-builder:cache"
}
```
- Open the `collector/` directory in a new instance of Visual Studio Code and when prompted select **Reopen In Container**, a new container should be created and the workspace directory will be mounted inside of it.

#### Teardown
Closing the Visual Studio Code instance will stop the container.

#### Important note on performance
Even though development containers is a supported feature of `Docker for Desktop`, there is a [bug](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/3677) that tanks performance when running containers with mounted volumes. A possible workaround is to setup docker to run inside a VM and mounting the work directories using NFS.

### Building collector image(s) from the command-line
- `make image` will create the Red Hat based collector image.

### Setting up git hooks

Git hooks are configured in the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com)
In order to use them install pre-commit, and run `git config core.hooksPath ./githooks/` from the collector root directory.
