Welcome to the Stackrox Collector project documentation. Here you can learn
more about idea behind the project, how to start guidelines, design overview
and detailed references.

Collector is a component of Stackrox responsible for gathering runtime data. In
a few words it is an agent that runs on every node under strict performance
limitations and gathers the data via kernel modules or eBPF probes (the default
collection mode nowadays). To implement eBPF probes and collect data, the
project leverages the Falco libraries via a custom
[fork](https://github.com/stackrox/falcosecurity-libs).
