# This file contains the collector versions that are used in Rox releases.
# Lines starting with a # character are ignored. In general, only the first token in each line is taken into account.
# Still, it is good practice to prefix any comments with a # character.
# Note: this file does not contain a comprehensive history of all collector versions referenced in Rox
# releases; it is occasionally cleaned up to reflect our 6 months support policy.
# See the RELEASED_VERSIONS.unsupported file in the same directory for entries corresponding to
# now-unsupported releases.
# IMPORTANT: THIS FILE ALWAYS NEEDS TO END WITH A NEWLINE CHARACTER
