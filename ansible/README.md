# Collector Ansible Tools

The files contained within this directory are [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/resources/get-started)
roles and playbooks written to simplify VM life-cycle control, and execution of testing, both
during development and on CI systems[^1].

## Prerequisites

In order to run these playbooks you must have a python version >=3.9.
To install ansible and the necessary dependencies, simply run:

```
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

On a Mac, the default python3 is 3.7, so use brew to install the latest ansible:

```
$ brew install ansible
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Overview

The top-level yaml files define playbooks to perform various actions, and can
be run either directly with `ansible-playbook` or through the Makefile targets.

For example, to create and provision RHEL VMs for testing:

```bash
$ VM_TYPE=rhel ansible-playbook -i dev vm-lifecycle.yml --tags setup

# note you only need to specify VM_TYPE when creating VMs
$ ansible-playbook -i dev vm-lifecycle.yml --tags provision
```

Alternatively you can use the `integration-tests.yml` playbook to handle
creation and deletion of VMs as well as running the integration tests against
them:

```bash
$ VM_TYPE=rhel ansible-playbook -i dev integration-tests.yml
```

Note: the `integration-tests.yml` playbook also supports the `setup`, `provision`
`run-tests` and `teardown` tags to run each stage of the process.


## VMs

Within `vars/all.yml` there exists configuration for a variety of VM types,
summarized below:

| Type          | Families       |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| rhel          | rhel-7 <br> rhel-8 |
| rhel-sap      | rhel-8-4-sap-ha <br> rhel-8-6-sap-ha |
| cos           | cos-stable <br> cos-beta <br> cos-dev |
| sles          | sles-12 <br> sles-15 |
| ubuntu-os     | ubuntu-1804-lts <br> ubuntu-2004-lts <br> ubuntu-2204-lts |
| ubuntu-os-pro | ubuntu-pro-1804-lts |
| fedora-coreos | fedora-coreos-stable |
| flatcar       | flatcar-stable |
| garden-linux  | n/a (built from a specific image, see `group_vars/all.yml` for details) |

By specifying `VM_TYPE=<type>` the playbooks will create a VM for every family
listed above. The name of the VMs is defined by the inventory-specific prefix,
the VM family, and the unique ID (which defaults to the current username).

```
<inventory prefix>-<family>-<id>

# e.g.

# A rhel-7 dev VM
collector-dev-rhel-7-12345

# A flatcar-stable CI VM
collector-ci-flatcar-stable-12345
```

## Inventory

The inventory is [dynamic](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html)
which means that the hosts and groups are all derived from GCP. The `ci/` and `dev/`
subdirectories are [inventory directories](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#using-inventory-directories-and-multiple-inventory-sources)
and search the relevant GCP project for VMs that match the unique identifier. They are then grouped
based on that identifier as well as their platform.

The two groups are `job_id_<unique id>` and `platform_<vm type>`

These groups are used to run against only the VMs that have been created by the
same user or CI job.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables may be used to modify some behavior:

| Variable | Description | Default |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| GCP_SSH_KEY_FILE | The location of the private key file to use with GCP | ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine |
| JOB_ID | A unique identifier to de-conflict VM names | the current user's username |
| COLLECTOR_TEST | Which integration test make target to run. (e.g. integration-test-process-network) | ci-integration-tests |
| VM_TYPE | Which kind of VMs to create on GCP (as listed above.) By default, will only build rhel VMs. Use 'all' to build an inventory containing every kind of VM. | rhel |

Note: other environment variables that may affect the operation of the integration tests
can be used to modify behavior. See [the integration tests README](../integration-tests/README.md) for details.

## Secrets & Creds

The make targets expect some secrets to exist within a secrets.yml file in the
root of this directory structure. It should contain key/value pairs of variable
names and credentials to be used in the playbooks. Currently, the only required
credentials are quay_username and quay_password, which are created by make
from the environment variables `QUAY_RHACS_ENG_RO_USERNAME` and `QUAY_RHACS_ENG_RO_PASSWORD`
to match CI variables.

To create your own, for dev the format should be:

```yaml
---
quay_username: "<quay username>"
quay_password: "<quay_password>"
```

You can also encrypt this file using ansible-vault, should you wish to password
protect it, though you will need to input the password every time it is used.

```bash
$ ansible-vault encrypt secrets.yml
```

This will require some changes to any `ansible-playbook` commands, as you
need to provide a password. Add `--ask-vault-pass` to any commands.

## Available Roles

### create-vm

This role allows a playbook to create a VM on GCP. It is expected to run on
a host that has the GCP SDK available (which is normally localhost)

See [create-all-vms](./roles/create-all-vms/tasks/main.yml) for an example of how it's used.

### create-all-vms

Higher level role which creates all VMs from a given list. Calls into create
VM for the heavy lifting.

See [integration-tests.yml](./integration-tests.yml) or [benchmarks.yml](./benchmarks.yml) for
examples of how it's used.

### provision-vm

This role will setup a VM with docker and get it ready for testing. It includes
platform-specific logic, as well as bootstrapping of python/ansible on Flatcar, which
does not have python installed by default.

See [vm-lifecycle.yml](./vm-lifecycle.yml) for an example of how it's used.

### destroy-vm

This role will delete a VM from GCP, based on its instance name.

See [vm-lifecycle.yml](./vm-lifecycle.yml) for an example of how it's used.

### run-test-target

Handles running a make target in the [integration-tests](../integration-tests) directory
in the repository. Will attempt to run the target for both eBPF and kernel-module collection
except in cases where a VM is designated for a specific collection method (via the vm_collection_method label)

See [integration-tests.yml](./integration-tests.yml) or [benchmarks.yml](./benchmarks.yml) for
examples of how it's used.

## Layout

The structure of subdirectories and files largely conform to a common [ansible
directory format](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.8/user_guide/playbooks_best_practices.html#content-organization).

| Directory  | Purpose                                            |
| ---------  | -------------------------------------------------- |
| roles      | Common sets of tasks that can be used by playbooks |
| group_vars | Variables for specific groups (or all groups), the filename is the group name. e.g. platform_flatcar.yml affects the platform_flatcar group |
| ci, dev    | These are [inventory directories](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_dynamic_inventory.html#using-inventory-directories-and-multiple-inventory-sources) that contain different variables based on where the playbooks are running. |
| tasks      | Yaml files that contain task lists |
| .          | The root of this directory is where playbooks should exist |

To find VM definitions see [group_vars/all.yml](./group_vars/all.yml)

[^1]: there should be no CI related functionality within this directory
      outside the `ci/` inventory.
