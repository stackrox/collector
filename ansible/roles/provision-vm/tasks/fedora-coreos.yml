# Fedora CoreOS does not have python installed by default
# but we can install it. The commands here are 'raw' and
# therefore are somewhat more dangerous than the safe ansible-wrapped
# commands via shell or cmd.
#


# Check for python first, because the following steps will fail if
# python already exists so we just skip them if it's there already
# (this is usually an indication that provisioning has run more than once,
# and is likely to only happen during dev)
- name: Check for python
  raw: which python || true
  args:
    executable: /usr/bin/bash
  register: which_python
  # always run
  changed_when: true

    - name: Install python3

      changed_when: true

    # A reboot is required because rpm-ostree does not install python until
    # the system reboots
    - name: Reboot
