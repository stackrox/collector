# RHACS Collector

Welcome to the RHACS Collector project documentation. Here you can learn more
about idea behind the project, how to start guidelines, design overview and
detailed references.

Collector is a component of RHACS responsible for gathering runtime data. In a
few workds it's an agent that runs on every node under strict performance
limitations and gather the data via kernel modules or eBPF probes. There are
opportunities to catch in many areas, so let's start.
