# Stackrox Collector

Welcome to the Stackrox Collector project documentation. Here you can learn
more about idea behind the project, how to start guidelines, design overview
and detailed references.

Collector is a component of Stackrox responsible for gathering runtime data. In
a few words it's an agent that runs on every node under strict performance
limitations and gather the data via kernel modules or eBPF probes. There are
opportunities to catch in many areas, so let's start.
