Integration test runs as follows

* We bring up collector (which is built after code changes) and mock grpc server built off of next proto defs.

* Launch nginx container; exec and run some command.

* Mock grpc server dumps all the process indicators to Bolt DB.

* We bring down both the collector and mock grpc server to remove lock on DB file.

* The integration test verifies we have the process signals from the DB file on disk.
