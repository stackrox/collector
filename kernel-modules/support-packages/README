Support package preparation
===========================

Preparing support packages is a multi-stage process, consisting of the steps listed in this document.
To allow easy interoperability between scripts written in different languages, intermediate information
is stored in a certain directory structure. For simplicity, we assume the root directory is called METADATA.

1. Determine Rox version -> Collector version map
-------------------------------------------------
For every relevant Rox version, writes a file `METADATA/rox-versions/<rox version>/COLLECTOR_VERSION`
that contains the Collector version for this Rox release.

3. Determine Module version -> Rox versions
-------------------------------------------------
For every relevant module version, writes a file `METADATA/module-versions/<module version>/ROX_VERSIONS`
that contains all Rox versions that use a collector with the respective module version.

5. Generate index.html file
-------------------------------------------------
Generates a file `OUTPUT/index.html` that contains an overview of support packages for all versions.
